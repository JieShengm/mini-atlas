## Downloading the raw data

* Raw morphological reconstructions in SWC format can be downloaded from [ftp://download.brainimagelibrary.org:8811/3a/88/3a88a7687ab66069/](https://bit.ly/2VIvP3Z). Download three folders (`excitatory`, `inhibitory`, and `vip_dendrites_only`) and put them into `data/raw/morph/`. These files are needed to create figures that show morphological reconstructions.
